## Hey, I’m Divyanshu Sharma — I build the engines that power ideas.

<p align="justify">
In the fast-moving world of tech, flashy interfaces grab attention — but it’s the backend that keeps everything running. That’s where I come in.  
I design and build <strong>robust, scalable applications and APIs</strong> that don’t just work — they <strong>work reliably, under pressure, and at scale</strong>.
</p>

<p align="justify">
My toolbox? <strong>Java, Spring Framework, automation, and modern web technologies</strong>.  
My approach? Solve problems with <strong>precision</strong>, write code that’s <strong>built to last</strong>, and deliver solutions that <strong>make a measurable difference</strong>.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Over the last <strong>4+ years</strong>, I’ve worked across <strong>backend systems, cloud computing, data workflows, and even UI/UX</strong> — because understanding the full picture means building better systems.  
I’m also fascinated by <strong>business entrepreneurship</strong>, where technology meets strategy to create something extraordinary.
</p>

<p align="justify">
I hold a <strong>Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering</strong> and a <strong>Postgraduate Diploma in IT Business Analysis</strong>.  
Beyond formal education, I’ve grown through <strong>hands-on projects</strong>, constant learning, and the belief that every line of code is an opportunity to improve the world, even in small ways.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Outside of work, I recharge with <strong>music, books, gym sessions, games</strong>, and the occasional deep dive into <strong>manga or anime</strong>.  
For me, creativity doesn’t stop at the screen — it fuels everything I build.
</p>

<p align="justify">
If you’re looking for someone who can <strong>turn complexity into clarity</strong> and <strong>ideas into reliable products</strong>, welcome — you’ve come to the right place.
